Done right, recruiting is one of the most rewarding professions. Rarely do you have the chance to affect somebody’s life in the way that you can when you help them find a new job.

I didn’t plan on being a recruiter growing up (nobody does), but I fell into it after some hints from family and friends. Quite frankly, I was on the fence about it: I had worked with recruiters before and had no interest in joining that sort of operation.

I joined a classic contingency agency, where I learned how to hustle, understand candidates, and make deals happen. I rose to the top 3 billers in the agency’s history. Yet I also saw the mediocrity of it all: spray-and-pray emails, sleazy closing techniques, and general bad behavior on both sides.

Many companies needed help: they needed a systematic, proactive approach to finding talent, without all the sleaze that came with it. But they were not really finding it, as far as I could tell.

Bastille was born out of that frustration. And I hope it will usher in something new.
