FAQs:
- question: How does this work?
  answer: You take the assessment.  We grade it and give you “code review” type feedback.  We
    spread the word all over town of how awesome an engineer you are because we’ve
    seen it.  And it’s off to the races!
- question: What is the format of the assessment?
  answer: Using the context of a real world example of a service, the format consists
    of asking you to implement three features of said service.
- question: Why do the assessment?
  answer: We firmly believe the assessment gives us a good window into your technical
    ability.  This is really powerful as it allows us to find the right role(s) that
    match your skillset and strongly vouch for your ability to companies.
- question: What happens if I have questions that I can’t answer?
  answer: That’s ok!  Try your best to do what you can complete.  However, if you
    do have any clarifying questions or are confused about a problem, please do not
    hesitate to reach out for help!
- question: How long does it take?
  answer: We expect this assessment to take somewhere between 45 to 75 minutes to
    complete.
- question: Can I go over the time limit?
  answer: Yes, but please note how long it takes you to complete.
- question: What is the grader looking for exactly?
  answer: We take a holistic look and observe everything from your ability to digest
    the problem’s specifications, architecture decisions, implement working solutions,
    performance considerations and code quality.  We strongly believe that all of
    these serve as useful data points to extrapolate your engineering abilities.
- question: What can I expect after I finish it?
  answer: 'You will get detailed feedback in the form of a comment on your GitHub
    Gist.  This feedback will typically remark the grader’s thoughts on each problem:
    what he/she liked, what he/she didn’t, and things that could have been done better.'
- question: What if I am unhappy with my results?
  answer: We advise you to continue the discussion on the Gist (or over email) with
    our technical advisor, Karthik.
- question: Will I get fast tracked at companies by taking this?
  answer: Yes, in fact, a number of the companies we work with have incorporated our
    assessment into their own interview/technical screening process.
- question: Who grades the assignment?
  answer: Our technical advisor, Karthik Senthil, currently grades the assessments.
