FAQs:
- question: Is the assessment free?
  answer: Access is free. You only pay when you make a hire through us.
- question: How much is your placement fee?
  answer: Currently we charge 20% of the candidate's yearly base salary, with a 90
    day guarantee period.
- question: Do I have to skip my own screening process if I use this?
  answer: No. You can choose to modify your process, or keep doing things the way
    you've always done. Our assessment serves as an additional piece of information
    that you can use to evaluate a candidate.
- question: How do you enforce assessment timing?
  answer: We choose not to enforce time, but do ask candidates to provide us the approximate
    amount of time it took them to complete the exercise.  We explicitly constructed
    the assessment in such a way where spending a significant amount more time on
    it will yield, if anything, a marginal value.  Because we look for a specific
    set of signals to assess someone’s technical caliber, we firmly believe either
    the candidate innately possesses them or he/she doesn’t.
- question: Who should I contact?
  answer: Please reach out to Georges Janin at georges@bastilleagency.com with any
    questions or inquiries.
